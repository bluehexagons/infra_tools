# Shared assets and Git LFS

Identify the storage layer before moving or editing large files:

```bash
findmnt --target PATH
git lfs env
git lfs status
```

Replace `PATH` with the asset or project path. Do not print mount credential
files or include credentials in URLs.

Keep active Git worktrees, `.git` directories, package caches, build trees,
databases, and service state on local ext4 or xfs storage. CIFS and SSHFS have
different locking, case, executable-bit, symlink, notification, and disconnect
behavior. Use mounted shares for large source assets, deliberate import/export,
staging, or archives. Copy files to a local worktree before workflows that need
local filesystem semantics, then publish finalized artifacts back deliberately.

Git LFS uses the repository's HTTPS LFS endpoint and credentials; a mounted
share does not replace it. Use ordinary `git lfs pull`, checkout, and push
workflows through the Git remote. Do not create a `file://` remote on a share or
move the local LFS cache there.

Before writing a shared artifact, confirm the intended destination and whether
another user or job owns it. For a completed archive or export, write a
temporary sibling and rename it only after the copy and any checksum complete.
Do not reconfigure persistent mounts, invent share credentials, or delete
shared content unless the user explicitly requests that external change.
