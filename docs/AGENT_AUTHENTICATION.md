# Agent authentication

This guide covers file-backed authentication for GitHub CLI, Codex, Claude
Code, and OpenCode on managed agent VMs. Tool installation, authentication,
non-secret configuration, and browser website sessions are separate concerns.

## Supported files

| Tool | Target path |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/auth.json` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` |

These are the standard Linux paths used by infra-tools. Supply an explicit
file when a vendor setting relocates its credential.

Selecting an agent tool does not create authentication. Select tools with
`--agent-tool` and choose credentials separately:

```bash
--agent-tool gh,codex,opencode \
--agent-auth active
```

## Credential sources

### Active controller user

`--agent-auth active` reads supported files from the invoking controller user,
or the original user under `sudo`. `--git-auth active` is the GitHub-specific
form.

For `gh`, infra-tools uses the selected `hosts.yml` token. If GitHub CLI stores
the token in an operating-system keyring, infra-tools asks the authenticated
controller-local `gh` command for it. Other tools use only their file-backed
paths; infra-tools does not run them to create credentials.

### Specified files

Explicit files work when the controller has no local agent installation or
when each VM has a separate identity:

```bash
--git-auth-file /run/secrets/agent-1/hosts.yml
--agent-auth-file codex /run/secrets/agent-1/codex-auth.json
--agent-auth-file opencode /run/secrets/agent-1/opencode-auth.json
```

`--agent-auth-file` is repeatable. A source must be a regular non-symlink file,
must not be group- or world-writable, and must be no larger than 4 MiB. The
controller does not need the corresponding agent executable.

Do not combine active and file sources for the same tool. GitHub authentication
must come from exactly one of `--git-auth`, `--git-auth-file`,
`--agent-auth-file gh`, or the interactive token prompt.

### Interactive setup

`--interactive` can prompt for tools, Git policy, auth sources, non-secret
configuration, and optional pairing. Hidden prompts keep tokens and passwords
out of process arguments. Automation should use protected files. Dry-run mode
does not prompt for or stage credentials.

## Setup, status, and rotation

Initial setup installs missing selected credentials at the canonical path with
mode `0600`. Ordinary reruns preserve existing mutable credentials. The narrow
exception is a Codex target whose metadata definitively requires a refresh: a
staged, unambiguously current source may replace it.

Use `agent auth set` for every other intentional replacement:

```bash
infra-tools agent auth status 192.168.0.41 agent-1 --json
infra-tools agent auth set 192.168.0.41 agent-1 \
  --tool codex --file /run/secrets/agent-1/codex-auth.json
infra-tools agent auth set 192.168.0.41 agent-1 --tool gh --active
```

Status reports installation, presence, ownership, permissions, age, and safe
Codex freshness metadata without displaying file contents, tokens, or account
IDs. Rotation replaces the selected target atomically. Inspect status before
replacing a credential.

## Pull credentials from an agent VM

Run the pull command from a cloned infra-tools repository. The Debian or
CachyOS control system needs Python 3 and OpenSSH, but does not need an
infra-tools installation or local agent programs.

```bash
python3 infra_tools.py ssh-key enroll 192.168.0.41
python3 infra_tools.py agent auth pull 192.168.0.41 agent-1 \
  --output-dir "$HOME/.agent-credentials/agent-1"
```

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--tool TOOL` | Pull only `gh`, `codex`, `claude`, or `opencode`; repeat as needed |
| `--output-dir PATH` | Required private destination directory |
| `-k, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |
| `-p, --port PORT` | SSH port |
| `--overwrite` | Deliberately replace existing regular output files |

Without `--tool`, absent files are skipped. An explicitly requested but absent
file fails. The command uses the workspace's strict SSH host-key policy and
never prints credential contents or remote error text. It reads only the
canonical paths above and rejects unsafe ownership, permissions, symlinks,
changes during transfer, empty files, and files over 4 MiB. The private output
directory is mode `0700`; files are atomically written with mode `0600`.

Output names are `gh-hosts.yml`, `codex-auth.json`,
`claude-credentials.json`, and `opencode-auth.json`. Reference them with the
matching setup option or `agent auth set --file`. The command cannot export an
operating-system keyring; a `gh` file without an embedded token is not a
portable credential.

Pulling is for migration or recovery, not synchronization. Stop using the
source VM's renewable Codex ChatGPT session before activating its pulled
`auth.json` elsewhere.

## Portability and sharing

| Tool | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| `gh` | A `hosts.yml` with an embedded token is portable. A keyring-only file is not; use authenticated `gh` on the source controller or a protected token file. |
| Codex | `auth.json` is file-backed, but ChatGPT OAuth state is renewable per machine. Do not use copies concurrently. Prefer independent login or a dedicated automation credential. |
| Claude Code | Linux commonly uses the credentials file; macOS may use Keychain. A Keychain session is not exported by copying this file. |
| OpenCode | The JSON file can be copied, but use separate provider identities when independent revocation and audit are required. |

Sharing a static token means every VM has the token's full scope, provider
audit logs show the same identity, and one revocation affects every copy. Use
least-privilege, per-VM credentials where practical.

## Non-secret agent configuration

`--agent-config active` copies settings, instructions, skills, rules, aliases,
and extensions for selected tools. It excludes auth files and `gh` `hosts.yml`.
A setting that selects a keyring backend does not make a portable credential
file appear. Missing configuration is skipped.

T3 Code is an interface rather than a credential source. Its server uses the
provider credentials installed for the target user, while pairing state is
managed on the VM. Browser cookies and website sessions are also outside this
copying flow.

## Codex maintenance

Codex-enabled VMs receive a non-root daily maintenance timer with an additional
check after boot. It asks Codex to refresh file-backed ChatGPT authentication
only when safe metadata reports stale or uncertain state. It does not refresh
API-key auth.

If Codex authentication fails:

```bash
infra-tools agent doctor HOST USER --tool codex --capability host --json
infra-tools agent auth status HOST USER --tool codex --json
```

Inspect `codex-auth-maintenance.service` when the timer is present. If the file
is invalid, lacks required refresh state, or remains stale after provider
rejection, authenticate the VM independently or deliberately replace it with
`agent auth set`.

## Security and lifecycle

- Keep sources in protected directories outside repositories.
- Credential source paths and payloads are not stored in setup history.
- Setup removes transient staged copies after success or failure.
- Use separate identities for separate revocation and audit boundaries.
- Revoke provider-side credentials when a VM retires or may be compromised.
- Do not distribute one renewable Codex ChatGPT session to concurrent VMs.
