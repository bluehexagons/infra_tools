# T3 Code Agent VM Improvement Plan

Status: active implementation; phases 1 through 3 and the phase 4 restart and
durable-readiness boundaries are code-complete as of 2026-08-27, with
disposable-VM deployment validation still pending.

## Objective

Make infra-tools-managed T3 Code VMs easier to operate during long agent
sessions without turning the base profile into an implicit collection of every
runtime and automation tool. Preserve the existing user-scoped service,
credential, repository, HTTPS, and pairing boundaries.

## Evidence and design decisions

A representative active `agent_code_vm` passed both the T3 Code and Playwright
doctor checks while operating with 1.8 GiB of guest memory, 1 GiB of used swap,
and a T3 service memory peak above 3.5 GiB. Its 32 GiB root filesystem was 73%
used. The largest rebuildable or bounded areas included a 3.4 GiB npm cache,
1.3 GiB of Playwright browser data, and more than 600 MiB of T3 logs.

The T3 client also supplied collaborative preview automation in the same
session. A second VM-local Playwright runtime is still useful for SSH-only
sessions, standalone Codex or OpenCode, and reproducible headless checks, but
it does not need to be installed on every T3-focused VM.

These observations lead to four rules:

1. Service readiness and operating headroom are separate diagnostic results.
2. T3-native preview is the preferred interactive path; Playwright remains an
   explicit `--browser-automation playwright` fallback.
3. Automated cleanup may touch only allowlisted, rebuildable, or clearly
   rotated data. Vendor-managed active versions and agent session state are
   not generic caches.
4. Concurrent tasks need repository and port isolation without overwriting a
   dirty checkout.

## Delivery phases

### Phase 1: profile and diagnostic baseline

Completed in `6c050dc`.

- Remove Playwright from the implicit `agent_code_vm` defaults while retaining
  the existing explicit browser-automation flag.
- Add a stable `agent doctor --capability host` text and JSON result covering
  memory, swap, disk, bounded agent storage, T3 cgroup pressure, maintenance
  timers, and pending reboots.
- Keep advisory capacity issues as warnings; fail only for critical filesystem
  pressure or a recorded maintenance failure.
- Extend the managed T3 skill to choose native preview when available and the
  explicit Playwright fallback for SSH-only sessions.

### Phase 2: bounded storage lifecycle

Implemented with conservative ownership boundaries. npm `_npx` workspaces and
numbered T3 log rotations are now bounded by the user maintenance job.
Playwright already records every consuming installation in its shared `.links`
registry and performs reference-aware garbage collection; infra-tools will not
add a competing directory-deletion mechanism that could remove another
client's browser. Codex standalone releases remain diagnostic-only vendor
rollback state.

- Bound stale npm `npx` workspaces independently of npm's content cache.
- Prune only rotated T3 provider and trace logs, retaining current log files
  and recent diagnostic history.
- Preserve Playwright's reference-aware shared-browser lifecycle and verify its
  garbage collection during pinned version upgrades.
- Report extra Codex standalone releases without deleting vendor-managed
  rollback state automatically.
- Add dry-run and real-VM coverage for every cleanup boundary.

### Phase 3: task isolation and operator evidence

Implemented with a local managed-worktree lifecycle, redacted JSON support
snapshot, and focused workspace, deployment-smoke, and VM-triage skills. Port
allocation stays with the existing `infra-web preview start` and `forward add
--listen auto` paths so the VM has one source of truth for loopback processes,
HTTPS listeners, UFW policy, and cleanup.

- Add managed per-task Git worktree creation, listing, status, and explicit
  cleanup with safe repository and branch validation.
- Allocate loopback preview ports without exposing them; use the existing
  HTTPS gateway when a user requests a shared preview.
- Add a redacted support-bundle command composed from the stable doctor
  results, versions, service state, and bounded logs.
- Install focused workspace, deployment-smoke, and VM-triage skills alongside
  the existing T3 and HTTPS-gateway skills.

### Phase 4: disruptive maintenance and version policy

- Implemented a private 1–72 hour agent-host maintenance hold and taught the
  existing automatic-restart policy to defer for active agent, build, Git,
  managed-worktree, and terminal-multiplexer workloads. Only category names
  are recorded; command lines and repository paths are never recorded.
- The managed T3 workflow now records the existing composite T3 and host
  readiness audit after a reboot or deliberate T3 update. Deliberate terminal
  agent updates record a tools-and-host audit automatically and include T3
  when installed. The private record carries a boot ID so prior-boot evidence
  fails closed. An automatic post-boot service remains gated on a disposable-VM
  lifecycle test; until then, the operator explicitly records the post-reboot
  audit.
- Finish desired-versus-observed version channels and artifact-level rollback
  for agent tools only where upstream distribution contracts support them.
  Terminal agents retain the deliberate update, verified executable backup,
  and automatic rollback path already implemented. T3 retains its upstream
  explicit service updater rather than adding a competing version manager.

The phase 4 restart behavior reuses the existing restart job and forced
deadline rather than introducing a parallel scheduler. Real-VM validation is
still required before the phase is considered complete.

## Acceptance criteria

- A new `agent_code_vm` does not download Chromium unless the operator supplies
  `--browser-automation playwright`.
- Existing saved setups that explicitly selected Playwright retain it.
- Host diagnostics never read or emit credential contents, repository file
  contents, prompts, or agent conversation/session contents.
- Storage cleanup rejects symlinks and paths outside the configured user's
  home, preserves active vendor versions, and has useful dry-run output.
- Workspace cleanup cannot remove the main checkout, a dirty worktree, or an
  unmerged branch without a separate explicit destructive authorization.
- Unit tests pass and each mutation-heavy phase receives a real Debian VM smoke
  test before being considered complete.
