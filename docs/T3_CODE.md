# T3 Code server

infra-tools supports T3 Code as a server-side web interface. It does not install
or manage the T3 Code desktop AppImage.

Use either the focused profile:

```bash
infra-tools setup server_dev vm.example agent \
  --t3code-ready \
  --access-source 192.168.1.0/24
```

or select the interface and providers explicitly:

```bash
infra-tools setup server_dev vm.example agent \
  --agent-tool gh \
  --agent-tool codex \
  --web-interface t3code \
  --device-pairing t3code \
  --git-access read-write \
  --access-source 192.168.1.0/24
```

The usual client is the separately installed T3 Code desktop or mobile app.
Generate a one-time URL from the control system:

```bash
infra-tools agent web pair vm.example agent
```

T3 Code sessions can expose collaborative preview tools through the client.
Use them when shared interaction or client-origin evidence matters. For
repeatable browser work that does not require collaboration, or a dependable
browser while the T3 application is closed, request VM-local Chromium
explicitly during setup:

```bash
infra-tools setup agent_code_vm vm.example agent \
  --browser-automation playwright
```

For a collaborative check, status may report `available: true` with no current
tab; that means the automation host is attached and the agent should open one
tab, not that preview is unavailable. After opening, use a snapshot-first
workflow and verify the rendered result of each input rather than relying on a
successful dispatch response. Viewport presets retain the desktop user agent,
and recording paths belong to the connected client's artifact store. See
[Agent browser automation](BROWSER_AUTOMATION.md) for the full interaction,
evidence, and fallback contract.

The collaborative preview uses the connected device's routes and certificate
store, not the VM's. If it remains attached but renders
`ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` for an `infra-web` URL, certificate enrollment is
optional. Route the browser check to managed Playwright when available, or skip
that collaborative layer and continue server checks. If the user wants preview
access restored, use `infra-web ca` and [Client CA trust](CLIENT_CA_TRUST.md)
for verified enrollment on Linux, macOS, Windows, ChromeOS, iPhone/iPad, or
Android. Never bypass TLS or make client trust a prerequisite for unrelated
operations. A timeout or unreachable private address needs network diagnosis
instead.

Agent-enabled T3 setups install T3-only preview guidance, or the combined
Playwright/T3 skill when both capabilities are selected, plus focused T3 Code
and HTTPS-gateway guidance. See
[Managed agent workflow skills](AGENT_SKILLS.md) for the installation matrix.
When Codex is selected, root-owned Codex requirements constrain new T3 sessions
to auto-reviewed workspace access even though the upstream T3 runtime currently
requests full access by default. `--harden-agent` uses the same workspace
boundary without an approval escalation path. This is a Codex policy and does
not change another provider CLI's native permission model or remove T3's
collaborative preview. See [Agentic coding security](AGENT_SECURITY.md).
The workspace skill uses the safe local lifecycle command:

```bash
infra-tools agent workspace create ~/repos/PROJECT TASK --json
infra-tools agent workspace remove WORKTREE --dry-run --json
```

The removal path rejects dirty, untracked, or unmerged work and cannot remove
the primary checkout. For a shareable diagnostic snapshot that omits log and
credential contents, use `infra-tools agent support-bundle`.

## Service and update model

infra-tools uses T3 Code's supported per-user background service. Upstream owns
the launcher, immutable version directories, service state, updates, and
rollback. infra-tools adds a systemd drop-in for the configured workspace,
host, port, PATH, and GitHub CLI environment.

The service unit is:

```text
~/.config/systemd/user/t3code.service
```

Its infra-tools settings are:

```text
~/.config/systemd/user/t3code.service.d/infra-tools.conf
```

User lingering is enabled so the service starts at boot without an interactive
login. Inspect it as the target user:

```bash
systemctl --user status t3code.service
journalctl --user -u t3code.service -n 100 --no-pager
tail -n 100 ~/.t3/userdata/logs/boot-service.log
```

The upstream launcher writes application startup failures, including native
module load errors, to `~/.t3/userdata/logs/boot-service.log`. systemd's journal
primarily records the launcher lifecycle.

T3 also records non-fatal provider diagnostics. It can health-check optional
agent CLIs even when setup deliberately omitted them, so a missing-Claude or
similar warning is not a failed configured capability; compare it with the
doctor inventory's `required` fields. T3 polls pull-request status for open Git
repositories as well. An intentional local-only repository with no remote can
therefore log `SourceControlProviderError` with `provider: unknown` while local
Git remains healthy. Do not add a remote or rename a branch solely to silence
that PR-only warning. Repair the remote only when the repository is actually
intended to use a supported hosting provider.

T3's trace and provider-event logs are high-volume. Managed user-cache
maintenance preserves current files while pruning numbered rotations older
than 14 days or beyond a combined 256 MiB. The host doctor inventories the
whole T3 log tree and warns beyond 512 MiB. Use that warning and the maintenance
result to identify pressure; do not manually remove current files from a running
service. A preview wait that intentionally times out can also appear as an
application error in the log and is not, by itself, a readiness failure.

Service readiness does not exercise the connected desktop client's preview
presentation. One recognizable stale state returns successful background
navigation or DOM results while `preview_open` produces no visible sidebar or
floating surface, status remains `visible: false`, and snapshots fail. Do not
open replacement tabs or diagnose the application and network from that state.
Restarting only the desktop client may retain the VM-side tab registry. If the
user accepts interruption of all active T3 sessions, the bounded recovery is:

```bash
systemctl --user restart t3code.service
```

Reconnect the client and retry one status/open cycle. Prefer managed Playwright
or non-browser checks when collaboration is optional. Restart the service
before considering a whole-VM reboot so VM-side T3 state is isolated.
infra-tools does not automatically restart a healthy T3 service on a normal
setup rerun or maintenance schedule because that could terminate the agent
session performing the setup; refresh/update paths already restart when the
managed runtime or service configuration actually changes.

T3 Code does not silently update after setup. A normal infra-tools rerun keeps
the active healthy version. The T3 client can offer an explicit **Update
server** action for this background service; prefer that action after active
agent work and terminal commands finish. Keep the client open while the
launcher downloads, installs, restarts, and reconnects. The following
host-side commands are also supported:

```bash
# As the target user, using T3 Code's documented updater:
T3_NPM_SHIM="$HOME/.local/share/infra-tools/t3-npm/bin"
env -u npm_config_dangerously_allow_all_scripts \
  -u NPM_CONFIG_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_ALL_SCRIPTS \
  -u npm_config_allow_scripts \
  -u NPM_CONFIG_ALLOW_SCRIPTS \
  PATH="$T3_NPM_SHIM:$PATH" \
  CC=gcc \
  CXX=g++ \
  npm_config_strict_allow_scripts=false \
  npm_config_foreground_scripts=true \
  npx --yes --package=t3@latest -c \
  'env -u npm_config_allow_scripts \
    -u NPM_CONFIG_ALLOW_SCRIPTS \
    -u npm_config_dangerously_allow_all_scripts \
    -u NPM_CONFIG_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_ALL_SCRIPTS \
    t3 service update'
infra-tools agent doctor --capability t3code --fix

# From infra-tools:
infra-tools setup server_dev vm.example agent --refresh-packages ...
```

The direct `npx` command is expected to work after infra-tools setup because
both commands operate on the same upstream-managed user service. `latest` is
appropriate only when the connected client is also the latest release. If the
desktop or mobile client and server differ, update the service to the exact
client version shown in the warning:

```bash
T3_NPM_SHIM="$HOME/.local/share/infra-tools/t3-npm/bin"
env -u npm_config_dangerously_allow_all_scripts \
  -u NPM_CONFIG_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_ALL_SCRIPTS \
  -u npm_config_allow_scripts \
  -u NPM_CONFIG_ALLOW_SCRIPTS \
  PATH="$T3_NPM_SHIM:$PATH" \
  CC=gcc \
  CXX=g++ \
  npm_config_strict_allow_scripts=false \
  npm_config_foreground_scripts=true \
  npx --yes --package=t3@CLIENT_VERSION -c \
  'env -u npm_config_allow_scripts \
    -u NPM_CONFIG_ALLOW_SCRIPTS \
    -u npm_config_dangerously_allow_all_scripts \
    -u NPM_CONFIG_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_ALL_SCRIPTS \
    t3 service update'
infra-tools agent doctor --capability t3code --fix
```

During a refresh, an upstream updater failure does not take down a previously
working installation. If the managed service file and active runtime remain
valid, infra-tools restarts and health-checks that runtime, reports that the
runtime was retained instead of updated, and continues setup. A first install,
a damaged runtime, or a failed readiness check remains fatal. Updater failures
include bounded diagnostics from both the beginning and end of npm's output so
an earlier npm error is not hidden by a later successful native-build message.

Keep the npm settings scoped to the trusted T3 updater. npm 12 blocks native
dependency scripts by default, but inherited `allow-scripts` or
`dangerously-allow-all-scripts` settings cannot be used by T3's nested
project-scoped install: npm rejects that combination with `EALLOWSCRIPTS`.
This also applies when npm reads `allow-scripts` from a user or global
`.npmrc`: the outer `npx` re-exports the setting before T3 starts. infra-tools
removes only those policy variables inside the `npx` command boundary and
places a managed npm passthrough first in the T3 service PATH. The passthrough
recognizes only an exact versioned `t3` install targeting T3's immutable
`.staging-*` directory. For that call it creates a short-lived, project-scoped
npm policy allowing only `node-pty` and `msgpackr-extract`, then removes the
policy before T3 publishes the runtime. All other npm commands pass through
unchanged, and the target user's normal npm configuration remains unchanged.

If npm 12 already produced an incomplete candidate and T3 rolled back, rerun
the same infra-tools setup on that VM. Setup identifies the retained `failed`
or `rolled-back` candidate from protocol-2 service state and rebuilds its two
trusted native dependencies without stopping the active working version. Then
retry **Update server** in the client. A refresh setup performs the same repair
before invoking the upstream updater.

T3 v0.0.35 also invokes `loginctl enable-linger` without a username. That can
fail in the sessionless `runuser` environment used by remote setup even after
infra-tools has enabled lingering as root. During the upstream update only,
infra-tools places a short-lived `loginctl` compatibility shim first in PATH;
it confirms lingering is already enabled, otherwise adds the validated target
username to that exact no-argument request, and delegates every other
invocation unchanged. The shim is removed immediately after the updater exits.

T3's published `node-pty` package has no Linux prebuild, so infra-tools also
selects the `gcc` and `g++` provided by `build-essential` for setup-time and
service-initiated updates. This prevents a stale inherited `CC` or `CXX` value
from selecting a missing versioned compiler. infra-tools validates the native
module, rebuilds an incomplete active runtime, and waits for several
consecutive healthy service and HTTP checks before setup succeeds. The same
active-runtime repair is available after setup:

```bash
infra-tools agent doctor --capability t3code --fix
```

As of 2026-09-01, infra-tools service and collaborative-preview checks pass with
T3 Code v0.0.37, including preview open, snapshot, semantic input, scrolling,
viewport and appearance emulation, and client-side recording. Keyboard helpers
dispatch after semantic pointer focus; programmatic typing can set DOM focus
before page input is pointer-activated, so retry a no-op key once after clicking
its intended target and verify the outcome. The validated runtime uses
service-state protocol 2, keeps the same `node-pty` and
`msgpackr-extract` native dependencies, and requires Node.js `^22.16`,
`^23.11`, or `>=24.10`. It also raises supported file uploads to 50 MiB;
infra-tools applies the matching request-body limit to T3's managed HTTPS route
while leaving the pairing route at its deliberately small limit. See the upstream [background-service documentation](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/blob/main/docs/user/background-service.md),
[update documentation](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/blob/main/docs/user/updating.md),
and [v0.0.36 release](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/releases/tag/v0.0.36).

Older infra-tools installations used a root-owned
`infra-tools-t3code.service` and a separate npm runtime. A subsequent setup
stops that service, starts and validates the upstream user service, and only
then disables and removes the old unit and clears its retained failed state.
The old service is restarted if the migration fails.

Removing desktop support from infra-tools does not delete an AppImage that an
older setup placed in a user's home. After confirming the files were not
replaced with user-managed content, that retired installation can be removed
manually:

```bash
rm -- "$HOME/.local/share/t3code/t3code.AppImage"
rm -- "$HOME/.local/bin/t3code"
rm -- "$HOME/.local/share/applications/t3code.desktop"
rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty "$HOME/.local/share/t3code"
```

## Network behavior

The safe default is loopback:

```bash
--web-interface t3code
--web-interface-host 127.0.0.1
--web-interface-port 3773
```

infra-tools publishes a managed HTTPS endpoint through its shared gateway. The
plain HTTP listener remains for local compatibility. For a non-loopback bind,
declare private source networks:

```bash
--web-interface-host 0.0.0.0
--web-interface-source 192.168.1.0/24
```

A non-loopback bind is rejected unless UFW is active and a private or
non-global allowlist is present. infra-tools reconciles only its own labeled
UFW rules and refuses conflicting unmanaged rules on the managed ports.

The protected device-pairing broker uses port 3774 by default. Its Basic Auth
credential is staged for setup and is not written to the saved setup command.
Prefer the HTTPS endpoints printed during setup.

## Git and provider behavior

T3 Code runs as the target user. Git identity, GitHub CLI credentials, provider
credentials, repositories, and the workspace therefore stay in that user's
home and configured workspace.

Useful checks:

```bash
infra-tools agent doctor --capability t3code --capability host
gh auth status
git config --global --get user.name
git config --global --get user.email
git config --global --get init.defaultBranch
infra-tools agent support-bundle
```

infra-tools configures `main` as the default for newly initialized repositories
unless the target user already selected another global default. This matters
for T3's branch controls: an unborn repository has only a symbolic branch name
and no branch ref until its first commit. To correct an existing unborn
repository initialized as `master`, run `git branch -m main`. Using
`git branch main` invokes branch creation instead and fails because there is no
commit to reference. Additional branches can be created or selected normally
after the initial commit.

The doctor validates the upstream service-state protocol and selected immutable
runtime, required native terminal module, active and boot-enabled user service,
endpoint, pairing helper, Git identity, and managed agent skill. Add `--fix` to
rebuild an incomplete native runtime, repair GitHub's credential helper, enable
the service for future boots, or restart an inactive user service. The separate
host capability reports memory, swap, filesystem and agent-storage headroom,
T3 cgroup usage, recurring maintenance state, and pending reboots. Capacity
warnings do not make an otherwise healthy service fail; critical disk pressure
and recorded maintenance failures do.
