# infra-tools documentation

Start with the [quick reference](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for a task-oriented map.
Use the detailed guides only when you need the configuration model, limits, or
troubleshooting for that task. The [root README](../README.md) is the project
overview.

## Agent systems

The [agent-systems guide](agents/README.md) is the focused starting point for
coding VMs and workstations. It routes to the relevant operational guide
without requiring readers to infer relationships among credentials, browser
automation, T3 Code, skills, and hardening.

| Guide | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [Workstations and desktop applications](WORKSTATIONS.md) | Desktop profiles, human-operated browsers, Flatpak, office tools, and verification |
| [Agentic coding security](AGENT_SECURITY.md) | Sudo, Codex approval/sandbox policy, hardened modes, and supply-chain boundaries |

| [T3 Code server](T3_CODE.md) | Headless service, deliberate updates, pairing, remote clients, and security boundaries |
| [Managed agent workflow skills](AGENT_SKILLS.md) | Installed Codex/OpenCode skills, capability routing, reconciliation, and maintenance |
| [Godot Engine](GODOT.md) | Verified graphical/headless installation, web/publishing bundles, agent access, and updates |

## Services, deployments, and data

| Guide | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [Deployments and manifests](DEPLOYMENTS.md) | `--deploy`, `infra.json`, static sites, services, and runtime behavior |
| [Deployment safety](DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md) | Persistent state, backups, rollback, and deployment boundaries |
| [Internal HTTPS sites and previews](INTERNAL_WEB.md) | Static-site publishing, supervised live previews, managed forwards, TLS trust, and cleanup |

| [Samba shares](SAMBA_SHARES.md) | Authenticated shares, credentials, access changes, removals, and SMB mounts |
| [Managed Syncthing](SYNCTHING.md) | Private hub-and-spoke file exchange, HTTPS GUI administration, relays, and recovery |
| [Storage operations](STORAGE_OPERATIONS.md) | Rsync mirrors, par2 protection, schedules, locks, and recovery |
| [Generic path backups](BACKUPS.md) | Provider-neutral backup mirrors, mounted destinations, parity, and consistency limits |
| [Proxmox workflows](PROXMOX.md) | Host registration, VM/LXC provisioning, lifecycle, resource pressure, boot ordering, backups, and smoke tests |

## Plans and contributor material

The [`plans/`](plans/) directory contains implementation plans and audit
records. It is not operator documentation; start with the
[planning index](plans/README.md) only when researching project work.

Repository contributors should read the
[contributor and coding-agent guide](agents/contributing/README.md). It
describes repository change rules, not how to administer an
infra-tools-managed machine.

## Documentation conventions

Guides should lead with the task, use short procedures and tables for lookup,
and link to a detailed reference rather than duplicate it. Examples use the
installed `infra-tools` launcher and placeholders only; never put real secrets
in documentation.
