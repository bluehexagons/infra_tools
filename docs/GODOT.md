# Godot Engine

Use `--godot` with any setup profile to install the newest stable standard
Godot Engine release. The installer resolves the engine version at run time;
the `v2.0.0` infra-tools release therefore does not pin a Godot version in its
operator contract.

```bash
# Graphical editor on an agent workstation
infra-tools setup agent_workstation 192.168.1.40 agent --godot

# Headless editor/runtime on an SSH-only agent VM
infra-tools setup agent_vm 192.168.1.41 agent --godot
ssh agent@192.168.1.41 'godot --headless --version'

# Web export and itch.io/Steam publishing tools
infra-tools setup agent_workstation 192.168.1.42 agent \
  --godot-bundle web \
  --godot-bundle publishing
```

The standard Linux editor binary supports both windowed use and the
`--headless` display/audio drivers. The setup also installs a desktop entry, so
a graphical session can launch the editor without a separate build. .NET/C#
builds and export templates are not installed by `--godot` alone.

## Workflow bundles

`--godot-bundle BUNDLE` is repeatable, automatically enables `--godot`, and
currently accepts these bundles:

| Bundle | Installed tooling |
| --- | --- |
| `web` | Version-matched web export templates plus a managed HTTPS publishing origin for regular, single-threaded, threaded, and GDExtension-enabled debug/release exports |
| `publishing` | Butler for itch.io and, on x86_64, the SteamCMD command-line publisher |

The web bundle selects the official export-template TPZ matching the active
engine release and uses the same bounded HTTP range approach as Godot 4.7's
Export Template Manager. It reads the ZIP directory, downloads only
`version.txt` and the web template members, and verifies each member through
the ZIP CRC while extracting it. This avoids staging or transferring the full
all-platform archive. The cache is kept under `/opt/godot/export_templates`;
files are copied into the configured account's
`~/.local/share/godot/export_templates/VERSION` directory so graphical users
and agents running as that account see the same export targets.

### Managed HTTPS web hosting

The web bundle also installs an isolated Nginx origin on TCP 8443. Setup opens
that port through the same UFW and `--access-source` policy as other managed
web ports, creates a publishing directory for the configured account, and
installs `infra-web` plus the `godot-web-publish` compatibility command
system-wide. A project with a `Web` export preset can be exported and activated
without writing a game-specific service or Nginx configuration:

```bash
cd ~/repos/my-game
# Complete resource imports on a fresh checkout or after asset changes:
godot --headless --path . --import
infra-web publish godot --json
# Use another preset or create a debug export when needed:
infra-web publish godot my-game --preset "Web Threads" --debug --json
```

The resulting URL is
`https://HOST:8443/games/USERNAME/my-game/`. The host sends the secure-context
and cross-origin isolation headers required by threaded and web GDExtension
exports:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

The same endpoint works for Godot's default single-threaded exports. The
publisher derives a URL-safe name from `application/config/name` when a name is
not supplied, creates deterministic gzip copies of `.wasm` and `.pck` files,
and updates a per-user game catalog. Nginx serves those precompressed files
when the browser accepts gzip. Published games are replaced only after Godot
completes a new export, with a per-game lock so unrelated games may publish in
parallel without conflicting updates. A failed build does not remove the last
working copy.

Before compression, metadata writes, or permission changes, the publisher
rejects symlinks, multiply linked files, and special files in generated output.
Export plugins must produce ordinary files and directories. Rejected exports
leave the previous publication and files outside the staging directory intact.

Use the same utility for inspection and cleanup:

```bash
infra-web list
infra-web url my-game
infra-web doctor my-game
infra-web remove my-game --yes
```

`doctor` verifies trusted HTTPS, the secure-context and cross-origin isolation
headers, and the `application/wasm` content type. `--json` is available on
publish, list, and doctor for agent automation. Publication JSON suppresses
Godot's progress stream and reports elapsed time, exported artifact counts and
sizes, and whether the prior snapshot was replaced. `--open` opens a successful
publication in the user's default browser. Treat the URL returned by
`infra-web` as authoritative: static games are paths behind the shared Nginx
HTTPS listener, not processes bound to game-specific ports.

### Live HTTPS forwarding

Static game exports share port 8443 and do not consume one port per game. For a
live development server, use the supervised preview lifecycle:

```bash
sudo infra-web preview start my-preview --project . --profile godot -- \
  my-preview-server --host '{host}' --port '{port}'

infra-web preview list
infra-web doctor my-preview
sudo infra-web preview stop my-preview
```

When another process manager already owns the service, bind it to a loopback
address and register a low-level managed HTTPS listener:

```bash
# In one shell, the application listens only inside the VM.
my-preview-server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000

# In another shell, allocate HTTPS and apply Godot's required headers.
sudo infra-web forward add my-preview \
  --listen auto \
  --to 127.0.0.1:3000 \
  --profile godot

infra-web forward list
infra-web doctor my-preview
sudo infra-web forward remove my-preview
```

See [Internal HTTPS sites and live previews](INTERNAL_WEB.md) for static-site
publishing, automatic Vite previews, service lifecycle, health waits, logs,
cleanup, and certificate trust.

The configured account already has the VM setup's non-interactive sudo access;
preview and forward mutations require it, while publication and inspection do
not. `infra-web` allocates TCP 8444–8999 by default, restricts upstreams to
unprivileged loopback ports, reuses the managed certificate, enables WebSocket
proxying, inherits the saved `--access-source` policy, and reconciles
comment-tagged UFW rules. It validates Nginx before a reload and restores the
previous generated configuration and state when a mutation fails. Raw Nginx
directives, non-loopback targets, and source-policy overrides are not accepted.
The `--to` port is private HTTP on loopback; the allocated `--listen` port is
public HTTPS on Nginx, and only that listener is opened through the managed
firewall policy.

If a current Let's Encrypt certificate already exists for a configured DNS
name, the origin reuses it. Otherwise setup creates a VM-local certificate
authority, installs it into the VM's system trust store, and issues a server
certificate covering the configured identities, active non-loopback interface
addresses, system hostname, and loopback names. It also enrolls the CA in each
managed user's Chromium NSS database, so Playwright and Chromium-based agents
on the VM trust the same origin as system tools. A browser on another computer
must trust that VM CA only if it needs to open the private origin; client CA
enrollment is optional. Until the user chooses to enroll it, use managed
Playwright on the VM for browser coverage or skip the client-origin browser
check and continue with server-side verification. A publicly trusted
certificate cannot be issued automatically for a private IP or an unowned
internal hostname. Setup prints the CA file fingerprint, and the user-readable
certificate is available on the VM at:

```text
/srv/infra-tools/web/infra-tools-ca.crt
```

Run `infra-web ca` to print the active CA path and SHA-256 fingerprint. When an
existing publicly trusted certificate is in use, the command reports that no
private CA enrollment is required. Follow [Client CA trust](CLIENT_CA_TRUST.md)
to verify and enroll the public CA on a Linux, macOS, Windows, ChromeOS,
iPhone/iPad, or Android client. Never use an insecure TLS bypass for an agent
or browser check.

The private CA key remains root-only. Re-running setup preserves the CA and
renews the server certificate when its names change or it approaches expiry.
The weekly Godot maintenance run also reconciles the certificate, Nginx site,
publishing users, and export templates. No game-specific TLS renewal job is
needed.

The publishing bundle installs verified Butler GitHub releases system-wide as
`butler`. It also installs Valve's pinned SteamCMD bootstrap in the configured
account's `~/.local/share/infra_tools/steamcmd` directory and exposes it as
`~/.local/bin/steamcmd`. SteamCMD performs its supported self-update when setup
or weekly maintenance runs. Valve does not provide a Linux ARM64 SteamCMD
client, so ARM64 targets receive Butler and report that SteamCMD was skipped.
Because SteamCMD updates its own user-owned installation, the publishing
bundle requires a non-root setup account.

infra-tools does not collect, stage, or persist publishing credentials. Sign in
as the configured account only when needed:

```bash
butler login
steamcmd +login YOUR_STEAM_ACCOUNT
```

Combine `web` with an explicit browser or the existing Playwright integration
when exported games need browser smoke tests. The origin and publisher are
system-wide, so browser-capable agents can test the same URL shown after
publishing without a separate server process.

When Codex or OpenCode is selected on the target, the web bundle adds the
`infra-tools-godot-web` and `infra-tools-web-gateway` capability skills under
`~/.agents/skills`, alongside the base workflow set. Both agents discover that
shared standard location. The skills teach agents to publish and diagnose the
managed origin, use loopback for live servers, and avoid direct Nginx/UFW edits
or TLS verification bypasses. They contain no credentials and are not installed
for a profile that selects neither agent. See
[Managed agent workflow skills](AGENT_SKILLS.md) for the full catalog.

## Browser and physics testing

Use healthy managed Playwright directly for repeatable VM-origin checks. T3
preview is useful for live shared inspection or client-origin checks and needs
the connected client app running. Its absence does not reduce Playwright's
canvas, input, console, or network coverage. Share selected screenshots and the
input sequence for asynchronous review; see
[browser selection and real-time capture](BROWSER_AUTOMATION.md#real-time-canvas-testing).

Identify the project's pause action before starting. Perform a short gameplay
interaction, pause immediately, verify that simulation and gameplay timers
stop, then capture and inspect. Resume only for the next bounded action. For
example, Snake 3D maps Space to a gameplay pause that leaves the scene visible;
check each project's current bindings instead of assuming Escape or Space.
For frame-polled movement, use the browser guide's
[bounded held-input sequence](BROWSER_AUTOMATION.md#held-input-without-intermediate-tool-delays)
so the game resumes and pauses within one tool call.
Godot's tree pause and node process modes affect different parts of processing,
so verify actual timer and body state, including any custom pause mechanism.
See [Godot's pause behavior](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/pausing_games.html).

### Collect a bounded debug trace

Screenshots alone cannot quantify physics feel. When the project task includes
physics investigation, add or reuse project-owned instrumentation, disabled by
default and gated by `OS.is_debug_build()`. For web debugging, export with
`infra-web publish godot my-game-debug --debug --json` using a distinct chosen slug
so the diagnostic build does not replace the normal game. A debug export alone
does not add telemetry or expose Godot scene objects to the browser.

Use a fixed initial state, random seed, and input sequence. Record the commit,
Godot version, physics backend (including Jolt versus Godot Physics), physics
tick rate, export mode, and input timing. Measure against simulation ticks or
accumulated physics delta, not time spent waiting for browser tools.

| Measurement | Capture and interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| Position and velocity | Stable body ID, world position, linear and angular velocity; encode vectors as numeric arrays and state the units. Use physics state rather than an interpolated mesh transform. |
| Chain constraints | Both endpoint IDs, actual distance, rest length, and `distance - rest_length`; compare peak and sustained stretch with project-specific tolerances. |
| Contacts | Contact count and per-contact impulse from the existing body `_integrate_forces(state)` callback. Keep scripted/applied impulses separate from solver contact impulses. |
| Gameplay | Session time, pause/loss state, inactivity timer, and active input; relate a loss to the simulation interval that caused it. |

For contact data, configure a bounded nonzero `max_contacts_reported` on the
observed rigid bodies; enable `contact_monitor` when using contact signals.
Collect `state.get_contact_count()` and `state.get_contact_impulse(i)` in the
existing callback without replacing its force logic. Record the reporting cap:
contact data may be truncated, and a zero count with reporting disabled does
not prove there was no collision. See the
[RigidBody3D contact settings](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_rigidbody3d.html#class-rigidbody3d-property-max-contacts-reported)
and [direct physics state API](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_physicsdirectbodystate3d.html#class-physicsdirectbodystate3d-method-get-contact-impulse).

Sample a few selected bodies at about 10 Hz for a short run, for example 120
samples over 12 seconds. Accumulate contact peaks/counts every physics tick
between samples so brief impacts are retained. Avoid double-counting the same
contact from both bodies. Keep the sampling phase consistent across runs and
do not log the whole scene or emit console output every frame.

Collect numeric state in physics callbacks, then aggregate samples and publish
on the main thread. If physics runs on a separate thread, use a synchronized
handoff; do not call the collector below or JavaScriptBridge directly from that
thread. Check `is_finite()` at the measurement source: represent invalid values
as `null` with an explicit invalid-field list instead of silently substituting
zero. Godot can coerce NaN during JSON serialization, hiding the original
physics failure. Use full-precision float serialization for numeric comparison;
see [Godot's JSON API](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_json.html).

This optional collector can be an autoload named `DebugTelemetry`. The project
calls `start_capture()` with a unique run ID and the metadata described above,
then calls `record_sample()` from its main-thread sampling point with
JSON-compatible measurements. It stops at the cap; the normal pause or
test-completion handler can call `publish_trace()` for a
shorter run. Call that handler where it still runs while gameplay is paused.

```gdscript
extends Node

const MAX_SAMPLES := 120
var enabled := false
var samples: Array[Dictionary] = []
var run: Dictionary = {}

func start_capture(run_id: String, metadata: Dictionary) -> void:
    if not OS.is_debug_build():
        return
    samples.clear()
    run = {"id": run_id, "metadata": metadata.duplicate(true)}
    if OS.has_feature("web"):
        var browser_window = JavaScriptBridge.get_interface("window")
        browser_window.__godotPhysicsTrace = null
    enabled = true

func record_sample(sample: Dictionary) -> void:
    if not OS.is_debug_build() or not enabled or samples.size() >= MAX_SAMPLES:
        return
    samples.append(sample.duplicate(true))
    if samples.size() == MAX_SAMPLES:
        publish_trace()

func publish_trace() -> void:
    if not OS.is_debug_build() or not enabled:
        return
    enabled = false
    var payload := JSON.stringify(
        {"schema": 1, "run": run, "samples": samples}, "", true, true
    )
    if OS.has_feature("web"):
        var browser_window = JavaScriptBridge.get_interface("window")
        browser_window.__godotPhysicsTrace = payload
    else:
        print("GODOT_PHYSICS_TRACE " + payload)
```

Call `start_capture()` for each diagnostic run; it clears both buffered samples
and the previously published browser result, so an unfinished run cannot be
mistaken for the preceding capture. Bound each sample's body/contact count as
well as the number of samples. The bridge assigns a serialized data property,
with no callable gameplay controls or evaluated code strings.
It requires a web template with JavaScriptBridge support; see
[Godot's JavaScriptBridge API](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_javascriptbridge.html).

After publishing the trace, use the managed browser evaluation tool for this
read-only expression and save its result with the screenshot evidence:

```javascript
() => {
  const trace = window.__godotPhysicsTrace;
  return typeof trace === 'string' ? JSON.parse(trace) : null;
}
```

A `null` result means no trace has been published for the current capture; check
the debug gate and capture completion. Match `run.id` to the requested run before
comparing measurements. For console transport, parse only the
`GODOT_PHYSICS_TRACE ` prefix and match the same ID since older console records
remain visible. Do not write game state through evaluation to manufacture a
passing interaction. Use a project harness that applies input at
known physics ticks when browser round trips exceed a gameplay deadline, and
report harness coverage separately from real browser keyboard/mouse coverage.

Compare repeated runs with tolerances for maximum link stretch, speed peaks,
settling time, and inactivity duration. A fixed seed helps reproduce the
scenario but does not promise identical physics across engines or platforms.
Keep screenshots out of performance measurement intervals because GPU readback
adds overhead. Finish with an ordinary release smoke test with tracing disabled;
debug instrumentation and paused captures do not establish release performance.

## Release and integrity policy

Godot itself is not installed from Debian's default APT sources. infra-tools
queries stable releases from the official `godotengine/godot` repository,
selects the matching x86_64 or arm64 Linux archive, requires the
publisher-provided SHA-256 from GitHub release metadata, and verifies the
archive before extracting its single expected binary. `curl` and CA
certificates are ordinary APT prerequisites; the engine version does not
depend on Debian's package catalog.

Verified releases are stored under `/opt/godot/releases`. The active release is
selected through `/opt/godot/current`, with system-wide `godot` and `godot4`
launchers in `/usr/local/bin`. Those launchers are on the normal system path for
the configured user and coding agents, whether they run from SSH, a desktop,
T3 Code, or another agent interface. Setup verifies the selected binary with a
headless version command before activation.

## Automatic updates

`--godot` installs `auto-update-godot.timer`. It checks the official stable
release channel each Sunday at 06:30, with the standard randomized delay, and
activates a newer verified release. The same run installs matching web
templates for every registered bundle user, updates Butler from its verified
stable release channel, and invokes SteamCMD's self-update for publishing
users. This check deliberately uses newest stable releases rather than the
general dependency freshness delay.

```bash
sudo systemctl status auto-update-godot.timer
sudo systemctl start auto-update-godot.service
sudo journalctl -u auto-update-godot.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

Engine activation failures leave the previously activated version in place.
If an older setup refresh already removed Godot's state metadata, the next run
downloads and verifies the matching official engine archive again before
repairing that state; it does not trust the release-directory name alone.
Bundle failures preserve already installed bundle files, fail the maintenance
job, and can use the normal `--notify` targets; if the engine already advanced,
the next successful run installs its matching web templates. Rerunning the
saved setup reconciles the same installation and timer configuration.

The roadmap reserves later bundle implementations for `dotnet`, `android`,
`gdextension`, and `assets`; these names are not accepted by the CLI until
their installation and update contracts are implemented.
