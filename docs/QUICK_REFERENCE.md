# infra-tools quick reference

Use this page to find the right command family and detailed guide. It is not a
replacement for the [command-line reference](COMMAND_LINE.md): read that page
before combining advanced options or changing a production host.
For a first experiment without a domain or SSH setup, follow the
[beginner walkthrough](GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Common host lifecycle

| Goal | Command | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preview a new setup | `infra-tools setup server_dev server.example admin --node --dry-run` | [Installation](INSTALLATION.md#install-and-configure-a-remote-host) |
| Set up a new host | `infra-tools setup server_dev server.example admin --node` | [CLI reference](COMMAND_LINE.md#setup-at-a-glance) |
| List saved hosts | `infra-tools list` | [Saved configuration operations](OPERATIONS.md#inspect-saved-hosts) |
| Inspect a saved host | `infra-tools info server.example` | [Saved configuration operations](OPERATIONS.md#inspect-saved-hosts) |
| View its saved command | `infra-tools cmd server.example` | [Saved configuration operations](OPERATIONS.md#recall-and-reconstruction) |
| Preview adding Python tools | `infra-tools patch server.example admin --python --dry-run` | [Saved configuration operations](OPERATIONS.md#patch-and-redeploy) |
| Update shares only | `infra-tools shares fileserver` | [Samba shares](SAMBA_SHARES.md) |
| Rerun a saved setup | `infra-tools deploy server.example` | [Saved configuration operations](OPERATIONS.md#patch-and-redeploy) |

`server.example` is a placeholder: replace it with your Debian target's IP
address or hostname, and replace `admin` with the account to configure there.
Remote setup requires root SSH key access and [host-key enrollment](SSH.md).
The saved-host rows require a successful initial setup in the same workspace.
Remove `--dry-run` from the patch example to apply it.

## Safe operating habits

- Inspect a saved host with `info` and `cmd` before a broad patch.
- Keep passwords and token-bearing webhook URLs out of shared output and
  tickets.
- Use feature-specific commands such as `shares` when they cover the intended
  change; they avoid unrelated setup work.
- Check [Machine types](MACHINE_TYPES.md) before expecting a kernel, firewall,
  desktop, or service capability in a container.
