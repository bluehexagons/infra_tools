# Sysadmin Convenience Commands

Quick-access commands for daily server administration tasks. All commands
inherit SSH credentials (username, key, port) from the saved infra-tools
configuration for the host when available, so you rarely need to pass them
explicitly.

Commands started in a terminal can prompt for a password-protected key's
passphrase. For piped commands and parallel operations, preload the key with
`ssh-agent`/`ssh-add`; see [SSH authentication](SSH.md). This is especially
important for `fan`, `df`, and `reachable`, which may create several SSH
connections at once.

## mount

Mount a remote directory using sshfs. The local mountpoint is created
automatically if it does not exist.

```
infra-tools mount <host>:<remote_path> <local_path> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `host:path` | Remote host and path, e.g. `myhost:/srv/data` |
| `local_path` | Local mountpoint (created if absent) |
| `--ro` | Mount read-only |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file (overrides saved config) |
| `-p, --port N` | SSH port |

```bash
infra-tools mount myserver:/var/log /mnt/myserver-logs
infra-tools mount myserver:/srv/data /mnt/data --ro
infra-tools mount 10.0.0.10:/home/admin /mnt/admin -u admin -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Mounts use `reconnect` and `ServerAliveInterval=30` so short network
interruptions recover automatically.

---

## umount

Unmount an sshfs mount by local path or by host name.

```
infra-tools umount <local_path|hostname>
```

```bash
infra-tools umount /mnt/myserver-logs   # by local path
infra-tools umount myserver             # by host name (finds the mount automatically)
```

When given a host name, `findmnt` is used to locate the mount point. If more
than one mount matches the host, you must specify the local path directly.

---

## health

SSH into a host and print a structured health summary:

- Uptime and load average
- Memory and swap usage
- Disk usage across all mounts (entries above 85% are prefixed with `[!]`)
- Failed systemd units
- Last 10 journal errors
- Pending apt upgrade count
- Reboot-required status

```
infra-tools health <host> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `host` | Remote host (IP or hostname) |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file (overrides saved config) |

```bash
infra-tools health myserver
infra-tools health 10.0.0.10 -u admin
```

Each section degrades gracefully — if a command is unavailable on the remote
host (e.g. `journalctl` on a non-systemd system), that section prints
`(unavailable)` and the rest continues.

---

## ssh

Open an interactive SSH session using credentials from the saved infra-tools
config for the host. Adds `ControlMaster=auto` for connection reuse.

```
infra-tools ssh <host> [options] [-- <remote_command>]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `host` | Remote host (IP or hostname) |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file (overrides saved config) |
| `-p, --port N` | SSH port |
| `-- cmd ...` | Run a remote command instead of opening a shell |

```bash
infra-tools ssh myserver
infra-tools ssh myserver -- journalctl -f
infra-tools ssh myserver -- systemctl status nginx
```

Uses `execvp` to replace the current process, so the terminal is fully
interactive (signals, terminal size, etc. all work correctly).

---

## push

Sync a local file or directory to a remote host using rsync over SSH.

```
infra-tools push <local_path> <host>:<remote_path> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `local_path` | Local source path |
| `host:path` | Remote destination |
| `--delete` | Delete files from the remote that are absent locally |
| `-n, --dry-run` | Show what would be transferred without transferring |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |
| `-p, --port N` | SSH port |

```bash
infra-tools push ./dist myserver:/var/www/app
infra-tools push ./data myserver:/backup/data --dry-run
infra-tools push ./data myserver:/backup/data --delete
```

When `--delete` is specified without `--dry-run`, a confirmation prompt is
shown before proceeding.

---

## pull

Sync a remote file or directory to local using rsync over SSH.

```
infra-tools pull <host>:<remote_path> [<local_path>] [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `host:path` | Remote source |
| `local_path` | Local destination (defaults to `./<basename>`) |
| `-n, --dry-run` | Show what would be transferred without transferring |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |
| `-p, --port N` | SSH port |

```bash
infra-tools pull myserver:/var/log ./logs
infra-tools pull myserver:/srv/data          # saves to ./data
infra-tools pull myserver:/var/log --dry-run
```

---

## key push

Append the local public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote host.
Idempotent — skips if the key is already present. Creates the `.ssh` directory
and `authorized_keys` file with correct permissions if needed.

```
infra-tools key push <host> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `host` | Remote host (IP or hostname) |
| `--pubkey PATH` | Public key file (default: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH key to authenticate with |

```bash
infra-tools key push myserver
infra-tools key push myserver --pubkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
infra-tools key push 10.0.0.10 -u admin -i ~/.ssh/bootstrap_key
```

---

## df

Run `df -h` on one or more remote hosts in parallel and print a combined table
sorted by percent used. Entries above 85% are prefixed with `[!]`.

```
infra-tools df <host> [<host2> ...] [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `hosts` | One or more remote hosts |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |

```bash
infra-tools df myserver
infra-tools df web1 web2 db1
infra-tools df web1 web2 -u admin
```

Hosts that cannot be reached are reported as warnings and omitted from the table.

---

## fan

Run a shell command on multiple hosts concurrently, printing each host's output
in a labeled block followed by a pass/fail summary.

```
infra-tools fan <host> [<host2> ...] [options] -- <command>
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `hosts` | One or more remote hosts |
| `-- cmd` | Command to execute (required) |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |

```bash
infra-tools fan web1 web2 -- uptime
infra-tools fan web1 web2 db1 -- systemctl restart myapp
infra-tools fan web1 web2 -u deploy -- git -C /srv/app pull
```

All hosts run concurrently. Output is serialized per host after all results are
collected, sorted by hostname for stable output.

---

## svc

Manage a systemd service on a remote host. Defaults to `status`.

```
infra-tools svc <host> <unit> [action] [options]
```

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `host` | Remote host (IP or hostname) |
| `unit` | Unit name, e.g. `nginx`, `myapp.service` |
| `action` | `status` (default), `restart`, `start`, `stop`, `enable`, `disable`, `reload` |

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |

```bash
infra-tools svc myserver nginx              # show status
infra-tools svc myserver nginx restart      # restart and show status
infra-tools svc myserver myapp.service stop
infra-tools svc myserver nginx enable
```

Mutating actions (`restart`, `start`, `stop`, `enable`, `disable`, `reload`)
use `sudo` and display a status readout afterward.

---

## logs

Show recent journal entries for a systemd unit, or follow live output.

```
infra-tools logs <host> <unit> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-n, --lines N` | Number of lines to show (default: 50) |
| `-f, --follow` | Follow live output |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |

```bash
infra-tools logs myserver nginx
infra-tools logs myserver myapp -f
infra-tools logs myserver nginx -n 200
```

Uses `execvp` so `-f` gives a true live stream with correct terminal behavior.

---

## upgrade

With no host arguments, update the installed infra-tools worktree on its
selected channel. With one or more hosts, run `apt-get update && apt-get
upgrade` on those hosts in parallel and report which require a reboot.

```bash
infra-tools upgrade
```

The installed-source form refuses to overwrite local worktree changes. See
[Installation](INSTALLATION.md#channels-and-upgrades) for channel selection.

### Remote host upgrade

```
infra-tools upgrade <host> [<host2> ...] [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `hosts` | One or more remote hosts |
| `--check` | Only count pending upgrades; do not install |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |

```bash
infra-tools upgrade myserver
infra-tools upgrade web1 web2 db1
infra-tools upgrade web1 web2 --check     # show pending counts only
```

Requires `sudo` access on the remote host. Hosts that fail are reported and do
not affect the result for other hosts.

---

## reachable

Probe hosts via SSH and print a latency table. Hosts that do not respond within
5 seconds are marked unreachable.

```
infra-tools reachable [<hosts>] [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `hosts` | Explicit host list (default: all saved configs) |
| `--pattern GLOB` | Filter saved hosts by glob pattern |
| `-u, --username U` | SSH username (overrides saved config) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |

```bash
infra-tools reachable                      # probe all saved hosts
infra-tools reachable '*.example.com'      # glob filter on saved hosts
infra-tools reachable --pattern 'web*'
infra-tools reachable web1 web2 db1        # explicit host list
```

All probes run concurrently. The summary line lists any unreachable hosts by
name. Exit code is 1 if any host is unreachable, 0 if all respond.

---

## user rename

Rename the account stored as a target's setup username. The operation runs as
a detached, root-owned systemd job on the target, logs out the old account,
moves the conventional home directory, reconciles infra-tools-managed units
and state, verifies SSH access as the new account, and then updates the current
controller cache.

```
infra-tools user rename <host> <new_username> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `host` | Remote host with a saved infra-tools setup |
| `new_username` | New local login name |
| `--admin-user USER` | Administrative SSH account (defaults to saved target user) |
| `-i, --key PATH` | SSH identity file |
| `--new-home PATH` | Explicit absolute destination home |
| `--keep-home` | Keep the existing home path |
| `-n, --dry-run` | Run target preflight without changing anything |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip the destructive-operation confirmation |
| `--resume OPERATION_ID` | Resume a staged operation after interruption |

Examples:

```bash
infra-tools user rename myserver newadmin
infra-tools user rename myserver newadmin --admin-user root --yes
infra-tools user rename myserver newadmin --dry-run
infra-tools user rename myserver newadmin --resume 7d4e...
```

The saved setup username is used as the old name and is checked against the
target account and both target state files. The command requires
non-interactive remote `sudo`, a local account, a systemd target, and an
unambiguous home directory. `root`, existing destination accounts/groups,
mounted or symlinked homes, conflicting cron/mail or managed SMB credential
files, and unmanaged system configuration references are rejected. Historical
setup records are not rewritten. The target user's SSH session is expected to
disconnect during the migration, so the systemd start request is detached
from that session. On resume, the controller tries both the configured
administrative identity and the new username; home-selection options and
`--dry-run` cannot be changed during a resume.

The target must already have the current infra-tools target files installed so
the migration helper is available under `/opt/infra_tools/lib/`. Run the
normal target upgrade first if preflight reports that the helper is missing.
