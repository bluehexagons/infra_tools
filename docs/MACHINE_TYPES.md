# Machine Types

The `--machine` flag specifies the environment type, enabling setup commands to
adapt configuration based on platform capabilities. The default is `auto`, so
the remote setup process makes a best-effort guess from the target runtime.

## Officially Supported Configurations

infra_tools officially supports Debian in these configurations:

- **Bare metal**: a physical Debian host, detected as `hardware`.
- **Virtual machine**: a Debian VM on Proxmox or a hosted VPS such as
  DigitalOcean, detected as `vm`.
- **Proxmox LXC**: an unprivileged Debian LXC container, detected as
  `unprivileged`.

The setup preflight also accepts Ubuntu and Linux Mint as Debian-compatible
best-effort distributions. Distribution-specific behavior outside the shared
APT and systemd interfaces is not part of the official support guarantee.

The detection is deliberately conservative. Use an explicit `--machine` value
when the runtime cannot identify itself reliably or when an existing setup has
a special requirement. OCI containers and privileged LXCs remain recognized
compatibility labels, but they are not part of the official support target.

## Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `auto` | Detect the target runtime and select a safe supported profile | Default |
| `unprivileged` | Unprivileged LXC container for lightweight compatibility use | Proxmox LXC |
| `vm` | Virtual machine | Proxmox VM or DigitalOcean VPS |
| `hardware` | Bare metal | Physical server |
| `privileged` | Privileged LXC container (compatibility label) | Proxmox LXC with passthrough |
| `oci` | OCI container | Docker, Podman |

## Capability Matrix

| Capability | unprivileged | vm | privileged | hardware | oci |
|------------|--------------|-----|------------|----------|-----|
| GPU/DRI device access | Explicit passthrough only | Device-dependent | Explicit passthrough only | Device-dependent | Explicit passthrough only |
| Kernel parameters | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Firewall (UFW) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Swap configuration | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Time sync (chrony) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| System restart | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Behavior

### Unprivileged/OCI Containers
- **Skipped**: Swap, kernel hardening (sysctl), fail2ban
- **Host-managed**: Time synchronization; installed guest NTP daemons are
  disabled while the configured timezone is retained
- **Attempted with graceful failure**: Firewall (UFW), auto-updates
- **XRDP**: Managed glamor when a supported accessible render node exists;
  software fallback otherwise
- **Flatpak**: Warns and falls back to apt

### VM/Privileged/Hardware
- Kernel, firewall, swap, and time-sync controls are enabled where the runtime
  exposes them
- XRDP probes for a supported accessible DRM render node and enables glamor
  when available; an emulated VM display is not treated as acceleration by
  itself
- VM and hardware setups receive host-level AppArmor, auditd, and security
  monitoring; the AppArmor setup preserves package-declared profile modes and
  verifies Debian's restricted-user-namespace browser sandbox support.
  Privileged containers may inherit those controls from the host

## Default Resolution

- Direct setup and patch flows default to `auto` and resolve the machine type
  on the target before setup steps run.
- `auto` resolves to `hardware`, `vm`, or `unprivileged` for the officially
  supported configurations, and to `oci` when an OCI runtime is detected.
- Proxmox provisioning defaults to a VM because the guest does not exist
  yet; use `--machine unprivileged` to provision an LXC instead.
- `server_proxmox` also uses `auto` and normally resolves to `hardware` on the
  Proxmox host itself.

## Existing Saved Configurations

Saved configurations retain their explicit machine type. New commands use
`auto`, while an existing saved `vm`, `hardware`, or `unprivileged` selection
is preserved when patching or deploying. This avoids changing the behavior of
existing hosts unexpectedly.

For saved configurations, prefer `infra-tools deploy <name-or-host>` or
`infra-tools patch <host>` over retyping old commands. `infra-tools cmd
<name-or-host>` prints an explicit override when the saved configuration is not
using the new `auto` default.

Proxmox host setup normally resolves to `hardware`, with automatic restarts
and forced restart deadlines disabled by default. It continues to report a
pending restart; set `--auto-restart` or a nonzero
`--auto-restart-force-days` only after planning guest downtime.

## Usage

```bash
# Auto-detect the target (the normal direct-setup path)
infra-tools setup workstation_dev 192.168.1.10

# Force an officially supported Proxmox LXC profile
infra-tools setup workstation_dev 192.168.1.10 --machine unprivileged

# Explicit machine types when needed
infra-tools setup workstation_dev 192.168.1.10 --machine privileged
infra-tools setup server_web 192.168.1.20 --machine hardware

# OCI container (limited features)
infra-tools setup server_lite 192.168.1.30 --machine oci
```

## Provisioning a Proxmox VM

The regular setup flow defaults to a VM when `--provision-on` is present, so it
can create the VM through `qm` + cloud-init without `--machine vm`:

```bash
infra-tools setup server_web 10.0.0.50 \
    --provision-on proxmox.lan \
    --memory 4G --cores 2 \
    --storage root local-lvm 32G
```

Use `--machine unprivileged` to stay on the LXC path.

Provisioned VMs automatically use a matching key from the registered Proxmox
host or the local `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `id_ecdsa`, or `id_rsa` identity. Use
`--key PATH` when the guest should use a different identity. The matching
public key is installed by cloud-init; `--provision-key` controls only SSH
access to the Proxmox node. The target is the guest IPv4 address: bare IPv4
uses `/24`, while `IPv4/PREFIX` selects another prefix.

For raw Proxmox addresses, storage shorthand falls back to `auto`. For
registered hosts, shorthand uses the saved/probed storage defaults first.

By default, the curated Debian cloud-image catalog
(`lib/cloud_images.py`) supplies the qcow2. Override with `--image`:

```bash
# Direct URL
... --image https://cloud.debian.org/.../debian-13-genericcloud-amd64.qcow2

# Pre-uploaded image on the Proxmox node
... --image local:import/my-debian.qcow2

# Downloaded image staged on a specific Proxmox storage
... --image-storage local
```

Refresh the catalog with `python3 scripts/update_cloud_images.py`. Add
`--pin-snapshot` to refresh entries to a specific upstream snapshot directory
and record its SHA-512. The checked-in catalog is pinned and verified by
default.

## State Persistence

Machine type is saved through `/opt/infra_tools/state/machine.json` only after
every requested setup mutation succeeds. The runtime path is a compatibility
link to durable root-owned storage under `/var/lib/infra_tools`, so refreshing
the uploaded infra_tools source does not discard release metadata, bundle
registrations, or maintenance state. Legacy state is migrated automatically.
An unfinished marker from the old non-persistent layout is retained once as
`setup-operation.pre-persistence.json` for diagnosis without blocking the
explicit migration rerun; subsequent operation markers remain durable and
retain their normal recovery guard.
The recalled setup is finalized at the same time in `setup.json`.

A real setup first creates `/opt/infra_tools/state/setup-operation.json`. It
records the current step and blocks another setup if execution is interrupted.
Ordinary failures mark it `recovery_required`. Rerunning the same system type,
machine type, and setup user resumes that operation and safely reapplies the
idempotent setup plan. A marker from a different setup identity, a corrupt
marker, or an `in_progress` marker still blocks setup for inspection; do not
remove it until the recorded operation is known to have stopped. Dry runs do
not create or change these state files.
